# Purpose of our app
- The purpose of our app is to allow users to keep track of their habits 
- The basic functionality is now working,
- Frontend features to be added could include a calendar, a email reminder &/or a general improvement in the CSS.


# Installation & Usage

### Installation

- Clone the repo
- Open terminal and navigate to the `weekly-fitness-tracker/server` folder

### Local Usage (Docker for Server and Database)

`bash _scripts/startDev.sh`

- Starts api & db services
- Runs db migrations
- Seeds db for development
- Serves api & client/index.html on `localhost:3000`
### If theres problems running startDev.sh (because of OS) ensure docker is installed on your system then
  Manually type the following:
   - For Linux OS: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up`

`bash _scripts/stop.sh`

`bash _scripts/teardown.sh`

- Stops all running services
- Removes containers

`bash _scripts/startTest.sh`

### Local Usage (Cient)
